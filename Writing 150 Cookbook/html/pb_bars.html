        <h4>
            My mother always made this recipe while I was growing up and so when I went on my mission, 
            I made these in every area that I was in when I was homesick. It also allowed me to show the people of Uruguay 
            a little bit of the American culture. In South America, peanut butter is hard to find and very expensive, 
            but in the U.S., we use it all the time. When I would make these peanut butter bars for them, they would devour 
            them and then beg for more. I gave them the recipe so that they could make them when I was gone, and now I am 
            giving the recipe to you all. I hope that when you make these peanut butter bars, it brings you joy and that you can 
            share it with someone else. - Alyssa Serre
