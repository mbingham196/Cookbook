            To create unity within our community, as students in Professor Spottsâ€™ Writing 150 class, we have decided to come together in a unique way. We have decided to create a Christmas Cookbook, featuring our favorite Christmas treats and snacks. Each of us comes from different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. But even though we may be different, one way that we can come together is through food. Food brings people together through sharing, communication, and long-lasting memories. As we communicate through food, we can connect not only to one another but also to our BYU community. We will incorporate technology by digitizing our recipes onto an accessible website so that everyone, including those not in our class, can enjoy them as they celebrate this Christmas season. 
Our community is built up of many different characters. Each character is complex with stories and experiences. With our diversity, we come together with common threads because we are all students striving to obtain greater education at Brigham Young University. What got us here differs, but what brings us together is who we are today: our morals, values, beliefs, and desires to learn. To create a firmer sense of harmony, we share parts of ourselves through Christmas recipes. During this Christmas season, as the Y on Y mountain blends with the white snow, we share with all our season greetings through an online Christmas cookbook. 
Our group specifically decided to create a website so that others could view our recipes and even add their own to the mix. With the advancements in technology, it has become increasingly easier to communicate with all different types of people through the Internet, and that is exactly what we did with this project. Not only were we able to communicate with our friends and family, but we were also able to communicate with diverse individuals who share our passion for food. We posted our favorite Christmas recipes on the website and explained why they were our favorites or why they were special to us. In the spirit of Christmas, our primary goal was to foster connections and to bring people together. We successfully achieved this by sharing our website, essentially creating a virtual gathering place where individuals could unite over a shared love for food. 
Lastly, as explained before, we used technology to achieve all of our goals. When we were first given this assignment, we debated on whether we should create an Instagram page or a website, but we ultimately decided to create a website. Creating a website gave us more control over how we wanted our recipes to be presented, and it also allowed us to create a different community than those found on Instagram. We all contributed to buying a domain name so now we will have access to our website for the next ten years. The realization that, despite personal transformations over this decade, our website and the community it houses will remain unchanged is both remarkable and mind-blowing. Astoundingly, this assignment served as the force that brought together our diverse group from Professor Spotts' 8:00 a.m. class, forging a collaborative effort that resulted in something truly exceptional.
