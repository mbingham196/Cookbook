            This recipe comes from my Grandma and is an excellent Christmas gift. Come the holidays my kitchen and dining room is filled with the aroma of simmering caramel and the air is hazy with powdered sugar. In assembly line fashion my siblings and I cut and wrap caramel by the hundreds. The only rule when making this recipe is that you have to make enough to share. - Jacob Hunter
