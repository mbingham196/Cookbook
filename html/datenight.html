            Scenario: you want to go on a date with an attractive person but need a good date idea because you are too ugly to get it without something she is actually interested in. So you hatch an elaborate plan to challenge her to a bake off. This is the recipe you use! I used it, and it works. The idea was good enough where she actually said yes and the cookies were good enough to where she got absolutely destroyed in the competition. 10 OUT OF 10! - James Rencher
