            I wanted to share this recipe because my aunt always makes this bean dip during the holidays and 
            it's always a great snack to share with the family. When she would make it, we would all sit around the table, 
            eat it, and just talk. I loved this because I could connect with my family through food. It's amazing how 
            food can bring everyone together.
