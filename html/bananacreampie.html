            This dessert was always a Thanksgiving staple in my house growing up, a family favorite and something I assumed was more complicated than it seemed. When I found out the recipe and how simple it actually was and how many things were simply store bought, its production superseded just the holiday of Thanksgiving and became an almost every event dessert for us. - Marcus Richards
